&lt;p&gt;A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, &ldquo;to write beside&rdquo; or &ldquo;written beside&rdquo;) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what a successive paragraph looks like. Some people prefer a space between paragraphs, while others prefer sucessive paragraphs indented with no margins between them.&lt;/p&gt;
